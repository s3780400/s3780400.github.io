								<h2 class="major">Interest in IT</h2>
								<p><b>What is your interest in IT?</b> Interested in coding and the use of computers.
									    <br>
										<b>When did your interest in IT start? </b>I always have been interested in IT when i was as young as 5, my brother had introduced me to games such as Space Invaders and Call Of Duty. However, this was more notable when i received my first Toshiba laptop in 2010. 
										<br>
										<b>When did your interest in IT start? </b>Growing up Bill Gates was a tremendous influencer in introducing me to the world of IT. Particularly, interested in applications such as Microsoft Word, who as a child was curious on how these applications were made. Not only this but at the time Bill Gates was the richest man in the world, which partially sparked my curiosity in the IT industry.
										<br>
										<b>Why did you choose to come to RMIT? </b>A mix between convenience and RMIT being a superior university when it comes to IT work. 
										<br>
										<b>What do you expect to learn during your studies? </b>I expect to learn the variety of fields that IT offers such as AI, security, cloud computing, the ability to cooperate with peers through projects and many more the course has to offer that will allow me to succeed in the future no matter what path i take.

								<h2 class="major">Ideal Job</h2>
								<a href= "https://www.seek.com.au/job/38564412?type=promoted&searchrequesttoken=80a3bcbc-95ca-4fd2-adb3-629a6ad2ed14"><b>Link to job</b></a>
								<img class="img-aro" src="images/aro1.jpg" alt="">
								<p>Position and appeal: An employee that will have an impact on the direction of the company in a supportive environment- allows me to challenge and overcome obstacles that otherwise may seem ambitious. With a range of “new and exciting” projects, it grants me the ability to sharpen and dive in-depths in the knowledge of web development as a whole, while bringing my skills and experience (hopefully) to other people. 
									    <br>
										Skills, qualifications and experience: Skills required is a strong framework of multiple languages and platforms (i.e. Javascript, PHP, SQL) necessary to perform the tasks given. They should also have advanced “technical problem solving skills”, accompanied by the ability to meet deadlines and work in a rapid environment. Furthermore, they should have the capability and intelligence to understand “business management systems” and “software principles and practices.”   
										<br> 
										Skills, qualifications and experience i currently have: Currently only have basic knowledge on Javascript, and do not have any of the other skills, qualifications or experiences needed to work for this company (or any IT related jobs for that matter). 
										<br>
										Plan on how you will obtain the skills, qualification and experiences: Hopefully through years of university education, private study, help through peers and teachers- I will be able to gather the skills and qualifications needed to achieve my desired goals. Through these hardworking and dedicated times, i hope to accumulate the experiences needed to apply into the real world.

								<p><b>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</b> When approaching work, it should be displayed through visual and auditory means to allow for a more consistent understanding in key concepts. It seems most of my decisions are subconsciously through feelings rather than rational thoughts- which could cause internal issues both short and long-term. 
									<br>
                                <b>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team? </b>I’m more extroverted than introverted, therefore, communication will be more prevalent, which will allow for proper management, organisation and communication with my peers to allow for effective and efficient teamwork. In addition, being emotionally stable along with understanding my work peers feelings will allow for a common ground and create a strong relationship among others. Furthermore, being assertive and conscientious allows others to rely on me in times of hardship.
                                    <br>
								<b>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</b> Have many individuals with opposite characteristics and different personalities- more diversity within the team creates various solutions and outcomes, thus, creating more dependable and steady results.</p>

									<h2 class="major">Project Idea</h2>
				                    <p><b>Overview:</b> A device manager is a control panel application in your Operating System that allows you to view and control hardware attached to your system. Device Manager highlights any piece of hardware (in this case a phone) and enables you to access the device from afar. In our application it grants the user the ability to locate, secure and remove information from their phone. 
										<br>
										<b>Motivation:</b> In today’s generation almost everyone in the world owns some sort of smartphone and therefore, It is a common problem that many people across the globe end up losing their phone due to it being stolen or misplaced. According to the Consumer Reports article, 3.1 million Americans had their phone stolen (in 2013) and this does not take into account the users who did not participate in the survey and other countries across the world, thus it is extremely important to not overlook this common problem. That is why if an application was created that allows the user to locate, lock and erase sensitive information about the user, individuals won’t have to worry about the unwanted consequences that may occur if such an  event were to happen. 
										<br>
										<b>Description:</b> In order for the application to be in play, users must first download/install the application onto their device and connect it to their respective Google account. Once it is accomplished successfully, the user can easily track and navigate their device through Google maps even if it’s constantly on the move, thus allowing for 24/7 tracking. When the device is unable to be found, 3 options are available to the user- locking, call or reset. To perform these actions the user must visit the website and enter in their Google account allowing the website to directly connect to the user’s phone. Once this is accomplished, the user can change the PIN or password of the phone. A message is displayed showing a relatives/friends contact number to help return the users device. In addition, ringing the device will be heard in maximum volume regardless of whether it is muted or not- the phone will continue to ring until the user cancels or the battery is less than 20%. For instances, where the phone is 20% the device will ring for 15 seconds until automatically turning off and leaving a voicemail. If the phone is completely out of reach and the other 2 options have been done the user can completely reset the device back to factory settings even if the phone is off, removing all information about the user. However, because this is done the user will no longer be able to access the phone through the website and is now free to use by someone else. So although your personal information has now been entirely erased someone who who stolen it will now have access to a new smartphone and can claim it as their own, this can be seen as a drawback of this application.
										<br>
										<b>Tools and Technologies:</b> A service that grants the ability to navigate the terrain and track the location of the user's phone(i.e. Google maps). A software that allows for the development of the applcation (i.e. Android Studio, App inventor). Furthermore, softwares such as Java Development Kit, which provides package of tools for developing Java-based software.
										<br>
										<b>External hardware but are not limited to: </b>Mouse, Keyboard, Monitor, Laptop, Phone.
										<br>
										<b>Internal hardware but are not limited to:</b> CPU, Modem, Motherboard, Power Supply, RAM, Video Card
										<br>
										<b>Skills Required:</b>As the application is compatible with both iPhone and Android, appropriate coding and software will be needed to allow the functioning of both smartphones respectively, thus it is a necessity to learn multiple coding languages (i.e. JavaScript, C++, Python etc). In most cases software required for the development of the application are free, many of the resources avaliable can be accessed online, however, developing such skill sets require time,effort and dedication. Therefore, recuiting other people with the required skill may be expensive depending on the skillsets of each individual.    
										<br>
										<b>Outcome:</b> If such a success were to happen, many people throughout the world would feel at ease knowing that if their phone were ever stolen or misplaced users can locate them, change security settings and if needed completely erase their personal information. Perhaps in the long-term it may de-incentivize people from stealing phones, save people money by reducing the cost of purchasing new phones and overall making the world a better place.</p>
